noBSstats Reading Group
=======================

I'm trying something new this winter: a reading group for the book.
We'll proceed with roughly one section per week, which you're expected to read 
on your own, and solve new the exercises I will provide each week.

Each week will look like this:

- Go through the assigned reading for that week (~30 pages)
- Attempt the exercises (send on Monday of each week)
- Check the provided solutions to the exercises (send out on Friday)
- Attend the Friday "office hours" if you have followup questions



Schedule
--------
Here is the detailed [schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Prwh9q-MTwScMLoH20rxmmNxZ9vEDx820nikQadxpkI/edit?usp=sharing) I have in mind:

Exercises
---------
I'll provide you with exercises to solve each week.
It's important that you try to solve these, not just look at them ;)



Discussion forum
----------------
I've setup a Discord serve `noBSstats` where we can have ongoing discussions
during the week, and async questions for people who are behind:

Friday office hours
-------------------
Attending the Friday office hours is totally optional.
I just wanted to provide you place to ask me question live.
We'll do this via google meet or on zoom.



Sign up
-------
This the reading group if offered free of charge for readers
who bought the [**No Bullshit Guide to Statistics**](https://gum.co/noBSstats)

I'll be using the Gumroad customers list for comms, so if you're interested
