noBSstats Reading Group
=======================

The **No Bullshit Guide to Statistics** reading group will run between February and April 2026.
There will be an assigned weekly reading of one section (roughly 30 pages),
which you're expected to read on your own,
I will prepare exercises for the new material,
with solutions provided at the end of the week.
I'll also organize a weekly "office hours" video call
when you can ask further clarifying questions.



Schedule
--------
Here is the proposed [schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Prwh9q-MTwScMLoH20rxmmNxZ9vEDx820nikQadxpkI/edit?usp=sharing) I have in mind:

Weekly tasks
------------
Each week will include the following activities:

- Watch the introductory video tutorial (5-10 mins)
- Go through the assigned reading for that week (~30 pages)
- Try to solve the exercises (sent on Monday of each week)
- Check the provided solutions to the exercises (sent on Friday of each week)
- Ask clarifying questions in the discussion forum if needed
- Attend the "office hours" if you have followup questions


### Introductory video tutorials

I like recording short "intro" videos for each section in the book.
These videos serve as "trailers" for what you'll learn in the section,
and aim to motivate you to spend the time to read the text.
I'll also introduce the key ideas using informal language.

I'll be recoding new video tutorials for Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 topics
and adding them to the existing playlist:

### Assigned reading

The goal of the reading group is help you stick with it:
this is a long book that will require several months of sustained attention and effort to go through it all.
But if we read it as group,
we're much more likely to stay on track and finish it.
I'll be reading the book as well,
while making the final pass of corrections and edits,
so we're in this together. Team spirit!
You can think of it as taking a STATS course:
we're the class of noBSstats 2026.

The weekly assigned reading will be very manageable: one or two sections,
which means you'll need only **an hour or two** to get through it.
But give me a good morning hour—when you're properly caffeinated and ready to handle some advanced math and code examples!



### Exercises

Each week I will prepare 5–10 exercises related to the reading material.
There are already some exercises in the prerelease v0.91 of the book,
but over the next few months I'll be beefing up the exercises to each section,
and preparing solutions for them,
which I'll provide for you each week.

The goal goal for the exercises is not to be challenging:
they are just spot-checks to make sure you're on board with the new material.
It's important that you try to solve thee exercises,
don't just just at look like a painting!



### Friday office hours

Attending the Friday office hours is totally optional.
I just wanted to provide you place to ask me question live.
We'll do this via google meet or on zoom.
The week day and time for the office hours will be determined
based on the responses to the sign up form.
I'm going to try to accommodate people in EST and PST,
but make the time also feasible for people in Europe.




Discussion forum
----------------
I've setup a Discord server called `noBSstats` where we can
have ongoing discussions during the week.
Sign up link is here:  
https://discord.gg/DEzBpZN4

Use the `#chapter1-questions` channel to ask questions
that come while reading the assigned reading,
and `#chapter1-exercises` to ask clearing questions about the exercises.
You can assume the discussions will happen async,
but I'll try to remain logged in on most days for fast turnaround time.

You can also email me your questions directly at [`ivan@minireference.com`](mailto:ivan@minireference.com),
but if you post your questions on the forum others will be able to learn from you.
