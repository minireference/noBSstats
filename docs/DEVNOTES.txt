# Roadmap

Features that I would like to add to this repo to facilitate working with notebooks:

- Run notebooks using pre-commit hook (to ensure repeatable cells numbered numbering)
- Run notebook tests as github actions (checks from neuromatch academy)
- Importer script for load/syncing ipynb files from google drive (see https://github.com/minireference/nbexporter)
  (use case: google drive acts as a source of truth to edit a shared notebook collaboratively)
- Split-off exercise solutions to create tutorial and solutiuonaire:
  see https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/nmaci/blob/main/scripts/process_notebooks.py
- External tests installable using !pip install https://github... 
  (this way we can have simple solutions hidden,
   and also allow more extensive testing than one or two lines-not cluttering the learners nb)
