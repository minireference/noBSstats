    "- Python is also very useful as a graphical calculator, you can plot functions, and visualize data distributions.\n",
    "- Python is an extensible, programmable calculator, which means you can define custom functions that are useful for any given domain.\n",
    "- Using Python gives you access to extension modules\n",
    "  for numerical computing (`numpy`),\n",
    "  scientific computing (`scipy`),\n",
    "  and symbolic math calculations (`sympy`).\n",

    "## Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is not just a calculator.\n",
    "Python can also be used for non-interactive programs and services.\n",
    "Python is a general-purpose programming language so it enables a lot of applications. The list below talks about some areas where Python programming is popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Command line scripts**: you can put Python commands into a script\n",
    "  then run them on the command line (terminal on UNIX or or `cmd.exe` on Windows).\n",
    "  For example,\n",
    "  you can write a simple script that downloads a music video from YouTube,\n",
    "  extracts the audio, and saves it as an mp3 file you can listen to offline.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- by running the command\n",
    "  `youtube-dl <youtube_url>`.\n",
    "  If all you want is the audio, you can use some command-line options to specify \n",
    "  `youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 <youtube_url>` to extract the\n",
    "  audio track from the youtube video and save it as an mp3.\n",
    "  The author uses this type of command daily to make local copies of songs\n",
    "  to listen to them offline. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Graphical user interface (GUI) programs**: many desktop applications are written in Python.\n",
    "  An example of a graphical, point-and-click application written in Python is `Calibre`,\n",
    "  which is a powerful eBook management library and eBook reader and eBook converter,\n",
    "  that supports all imaginable eBook formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Web applications**: the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) frameworks are often used to build web applications.\n",
    "  Many of the websites you access every day have as server component written in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Machine learning systems**: create task-specific functions by using probabilistic models instead of code. Machine learning models undergo a training stage in which the model parameters are \"learned\" from the training data examples, after which the model can be queried to make predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I mention these examples so you'll know the other possibilities enabled by Python,\n",
    "beyond the basic \"use Python interactively like a calculator\" code examples\n",
    "that we saw in this tutorial.\n",
    "There is a lot of other useful stuff.\n",
    "We're at the end of this tutorial, but just the beginning of your journey to discover all the interesting thins you can do with Python."
