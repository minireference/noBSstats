    "Package: A package is a collection of Python modules under a common namespace.

Packages allow for a hierarchical structuring of the module namespace using dot notation (e.g., package.subpackage.module).\n",

It's more of a broader term encompassing any reusable code that is used to perform common tasks.\n",
