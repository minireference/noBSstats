    "  $\\mathbf{IQR} = \\mathbf{Q}_3 - \\mathbf{Q}_1$,\n",
    "  away from the outer quartiles of the data to be an outlier.\n",
    "  This is the criterion we used when drawing Tukey box-plots\n",
    "  in [Section 1.3](../notebooks/13_descriptive_statistics.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **$z$-score criterion** allows us to identify values that are very far away from the mean,\n",
    "  using a multiple of the standard deviation as the measure of distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll now show how to apply these criteria to the data sample `xs`.\n",
