    "## Comparison of resampling methods and analytical approximations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we saw two different approaches for doing statistical analysis: resampling methods and analytical approximations. This is a general pattern in statistics where there is not only one correct answer: multiple approaches to data analysis are valid, and you need to think about the specifics of each situation. We'll learn about both approaches in the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytical approximations are currently taught in most stats courses (STAT 101). Historically, analytical approximations have been used more widely because they require only simple arithmetic calculations: statistic practitioners (scientists, engineers, etc.) simply need to compute sample statistics, plug them into a formula, and obtain a $p$-value. This convenience comes at the cost of numerous assumptions about the data distribution, which often don't hold in practice (e.g. assuming population is normal, when it isn't).\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, resampling methods like the permutation test and bootstrap estimation are becoming more popular, widely used in industry, and increasingly also taught at universities (see this [blog post](https://minireference.com/blog/fixing-the-introductory-statistics-curriculum/) about the *modern statistics* curriculum). **The main advantage so resampling methods is that they require less modelling assumptions.** Procedures like the permutation test can be applied broadly to any scenario where two groups are being compared, and don't require developing specific formulas for different cases. Resampling methods are easier to understand since the they are directly related to the sampling distribution, and there are no formulas to memorize.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding resampling methods requires some basic familiarity with programming, but the skills required are not advanced: knowledge of variables, expressions, and basic `for` loop is sufficient. If you were able to follow the code examples described above (see `resample_under_H0`, `permutation_test`, and `bootstrap_stat`), then you've already **seen all the code you will need for the entire book!**  I've prepared a [python tutorial](https://nobsstats.com/tutorials/python_tutorial.html) to make readers with no prior experience with Python will be able to quickly pick up the syntax."
