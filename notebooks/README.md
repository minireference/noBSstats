### 1.2 Data in practice

This notebook explains practical aspects of data manipulations using Pandas
and talks about data pre-processing steps like data cleaning and outlier removal.

TODO: add link to notebook with Alice, Bob, and Charlotte pre-processing steps.



### 1.3 Descriptive statistics
This notbeook explains how to compute numerical summaries (mean, standard deviation, quartiles, etc.)
and how to generate data visualizations like histograms, box plots, bar plots, etc.
