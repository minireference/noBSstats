    "  - The procedure we used is called a **permutations test** for comparison of group means.\n",
    "  - The permutation test takes it's name from the action of mixing up the group-membership labels\n",
    "    and computing a statistic which is a way to generate samples from the null hypothesis\n",
    "    in situations where we're comparing two groups.\n",
    "  - Permutation tests are very versatile since we can use them for any estimator $g(\\mathbf{x})$.\n",
    "    For example, we could have used difference in medians by specifying the `median` as the input `statfunc`.\n"

    "### Using statistics for convincing others\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering if all this probabilistic modelling and complicated statistical analysis was worth it to reach a conclusion that seems obvious in retrospect. Was all this work worth it? The purpose of all this work is to obtains something close to an objective conclusion. Without statistics it is very easy to fool ourselves and interpret patterns in data the way we want to, or alternatively, not see patterns that are present. By following the standard statistical procedures, we're less likely to fool ourselves, and more likely to be able to convince others.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be very useful to imagine Amy explaining the results to a skeptical colleague. Suppose the colleague is very much against the idea of statistical training, and sees it as a distraction, saying things like \"We hire employees to do a job, not to play with Python.\" and \"I don't know any statistics and I'm doing my job just fine!\" You get the picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine Amy presenting her findings about how 100 hours of statistical training improves employee lifetime value (ELV) results after one year, and suggesting the statistical training be implemented for all new hires from now on. The skeptical colleague immediately rejects the idea and questions Amy's recommendation using emotional appeals about necessity, time wasting, and how statistics is a specialty topic that is not required for all employees. Instead of arguing based on opinions and emotions with her colleague, Amy explains her recommendation is based on a statistical experiment she conducted, and shows the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the colleague asks if the observed difference could be due to chance, Amy says that this is unlikely, and quotes the $p$-value of 0.048 (less than 0.05), and interprets the result as saying the probability of the observed difference between **Group S** and **Group NS** being due to chance is less than 5%.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The skeptical colleague is forced to concede that statistical training does improve ELV, but then asks about the effect size of the improvement: \"How much more ELV can we expect if we provide statistics training?\" Amy is ready to answer quoting the observed difference of $130$ ELV points, and further specifies the 90% confidence interval of $[28.4, 237.6]$ for the improvement, meaning in the worst case there is 28 ELV points improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The skeptic is forced to back down from their objections, and the \"stats training for all\" program is adopted in the company. Not only was Amy able to win the argument using statistics, but she was also able to set appropriate expectations for the results. In other words, she hasn't promised a guaranteed +130 ELV improvement, but a realistic range of values that can be expected."
